Contributing
------------
If you want to contribute, make sure you read the following information.

### Coding convention
* Use the standard Sun Java coding convention.
* Use tabs for indentation and make sure you view those tabs in
  your editor as four spaces.
* Use Unix line-endings for consistency.
* Remember that Eclipse can easily auto format your code if you configure it
  right.

### Adding code
1. Clone the repository or fork it.
2. Make sure you pick an issue in Github to work on. If no issue exists,
   create it. 
2. Create a branch with the name of the feature/issue that you are working on 
   (`git checkout -b feature_name`)
3. Commit your changes, make sure you do this nicely. Rather ten detailed
   commits describing each individual change than one commit that says:
   `Implemented feature x`
4. Push your changes to the branch on github (`git push origin feature_name`)
   or merge with the master branch if you're finished:
   (git checkout master
   git merge feature_name
   git commit
   git push)
